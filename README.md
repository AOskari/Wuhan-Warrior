# Wuhan Warrior
This is a school project for a game development course. The main purpose was to practice object-oriented programming using C#. The project was implemented using Unity, as well  using Blender for creating 3D models.

# The game
The theme of the game is COVID-19. The player kills viruses that spawn from 5G towers and cars. In order to survive, the player must collect toilet paper, which are dropped when enemies are killed. Toilet paper is used as a currency, which can be exchanged for ethanol injections (using these returns health), epinephrine (returns stamina) and new weapons. You can also upgrade your weapons and mask, making them more efficient at destroying enemies or protecting yourself.
